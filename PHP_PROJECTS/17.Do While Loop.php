<!-- 
The PHP do...while Loop
The do...while loop will always execute the block of code at least once, it will then check the condition, and repeat the loop while the specified condition is true.

 -->
 <!-- 
Example
Print $i as long as $i is less than 6:

$i = 1;

do {
  echo $i;
  $i++;
} while ($i < 6);

  -->

<?php 
$a = 1 ;
do {
    echo "rahul-".$a."<br>" ;
    # code...
    $a++ ;
} while ($a <= 10);









?>
